# Initialization - GitHub Agent

Create multiple GitHub Actions that other can use:
- Post to X
- Post to Facebook Page
- Post to Instagram
- Post to Threads

Each action should be contain in its own folder, with all required files to meet GitHub Actions requirement PLUS an README.MD file documenting all necessary information (e.g. description, required parameters, credits)

Each action is backed by a python script performing appropriate posting tasks. A link to sample implementation of each posting tasks are available below
- Post to X: https://github.com/geraldnguyen/tellstory.net/blob/main/scripts/post_to_x.py
- Post to Facebook Page: https://github.com/geraldnguyen/tellstory.net/blob/main/scripts/post_to_fb_page.py
- Post to Instagram: https://github.com/geraldnguyen/tellstory.net/blob/main/scripts/post_to_instagram.py
- Post to Threads: https://github.com/geraldnguyen/tellstory.net/blob/main/scripts/post_to_threads.py

You are free to clean up the codes, standardize the behaviors, and extract common functionality to a shared module if necessary.

Create or update a CHANGELOG.MD file with a summary of the changes
