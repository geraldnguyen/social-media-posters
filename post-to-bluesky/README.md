# Post to Bluesky Action

## Template Interpolation

You can use template placeholders in your post content. The following sources are supported:

- `${env.VAR}`: Replaced with the value of the environment variable `VAR` (e.g., `${env.NAME}`)
- `${builtin.CURR_DATE}`: Replaced with the current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `${builtin.CURR_TIME}`: Replaced with the current time in `HH:MM:SS` format
- `${builtin.CURR_DATETIME}`: Replaced with the current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format

Example:

```env
POST_CONTENT='Hello ${env.NAME}, today is ${builtin.CURR_DATE} at ${builtin.CURR_TIME}!'
NAME=Gerald
```
This will post: `Hello Gerald, today is 2025-09-07 at 14:18:25!`

This GitHub Action allows you to post content to Bluesky using the official AT Protocol Python SDK.

## Security Notes

- Store your Bluesky identifier as a GitHub repository secret
- Store your app password as a GitHub repository secret
- **Never commit passwords to your repository**
- Use app passwords instead of your main account password
- App passwords can be revoked if compromised

## Supported Media Types

- **Images**: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp
- Maximum 4 images per post
- Videos are not currently supported

## Limitations

- Post content is limited to 300 characters (Bluesky platform limit)
- Maximum 4 images per post (Bluesky platform limit)
- Video uploads are not currently supported
- Link cards require additional metadata fetching (currently links are included as text)

## AT Protocol SDK

This action uses the official [atproto](https://pypi.org/project/atproto/) Python SDK which provides a clean, typed interface for interacting with Bluesky and other AT Protocol services. The SDK handles:

- Authentication and session management
- Blob (media) uploads with proper MIME type detection
- Post creation with structured data models
- Error handling and retries

Key SDK methods used:
- `Client.login()` - Authenticate with Bluesky
- `Client.upload_blob()` - Upload images
- `Client.send_post()` - Create posts with text and embedded media

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

- Ensure you're using an app password, not your main account password
- Verify your identifier is correct (handle or email)
- Check that your app password hasn't been revoked

### Media Upload Errors

- Ensure image files exist and are accessible
- Check file formats are supported (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp)
- Verify you're not exceeding the 4 image limit

### Content Length Errors

- Keep posts under 300 characters
- Use the `validate_post_content` function to check length before posting

## Local Testing

You can test this action locally by creating a `.env` file in the `post-to-bluesky` directory:

```env
BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER=your.handle.bsky.social
BLUESKY_PASSWORD=your-app-password
POST_CONTENT=Test post content
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
DRY_RUN=true
```

Then run:

```bash
python post_to_bluesky.py
```
