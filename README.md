## Common Features

All actions share these common features:

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with informative messages
- **Logging**: Configurable logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- **Validation**: Input validation for content and media files
- **Outputs**: Returns post ID and URL for further processing
- **Security**: Secure handling of API credentials via GitHub secrets

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API credentials** to your repository
2. **Use GitHub secrets** to store all sensitive information
3. **Follow the principle of least privilege** for API permissions
4. **Regularly rotate access tokens** and API keys
5. **Monitor API usage** to detect unusual activity

## Prerequisites by Platform

| Platform | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| X (Twitter) | X Developer Account, App with API v2 access |
| Facebook | Facebook App, Page Admin access, Graph API permissions |
| Instagram | Business/Creator account, Facebook App, Graph API access |
| Threads | Threads account, approved Threads App |

## Rate Limits

Each platform has different rate limits:

- **X**: Varies by API endpoint and access level
- **Facebook**: Varies by app usage and user activity
- **Instagram**: Limited by Graph API quotas
- **Threads**: Subject to Meta's API rate limits
