# Resolving Import Errors for Common Utilities

If you encounter import errors such as `Import "social_media_utils" could not be resolved` when running or editing the post-to-* scripts, follow these steps to ensure Python and your editor can find the `common` utilities:

## 1. Add `common` to PYTHONPATH

- Create a `.env` file in your project root (if it doesn't exist).
- Add the following line:
  - On Windows:
    ```
    PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH};${workspaceFolder}/common
    ```
  - On macOS/Linux:
    ```
    PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${workspaceFolder}/common
    ```

This allows both your scripts and VS Code to resolve imports like `from social_media_utils import ...`.

## 2. (Optional) VS Code Settings

You can also add the following to `.vscode/settings.json` to help Pylance find the `common` directory:

```json
{
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
    "./common"
  ]
}
```

## 3. Keep the sys.path Modification in Scripts

Each script already includes:

```python
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'common'))
```

This ensures the script works when run directly.

---
By following these steps, you can avoid import errors and keep your code modular and reusable across all post-to-* actions.

```yaml
name: Social Media Post
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  post-to-social-media:

        uses: ./post-to-x
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.X_API_KEY }}
          api-secret: ${{ secrets.X_API_SECRET }}
          access-token: ${{ secrets.X_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          access-token-secret: ${{ secrets.X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}
          content: "🚀 New release deployed! Check out the latest features."
      
      - name: Post to Facebook Page
        uses: ./post-to-facebook
        with:

## Common Features

All actions share these common features:

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with informative messages
- **Logging**: Configurable logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- **Validation**: Input validation for content and media files
- **Outputs**: Returns post ID and URL for further processing
- **Security**: Secure handling of API credentials via GitHub secrets

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API credentials** to your repository
2. **Use GitHub secrets** to store all sensitive information
3. **Follow the principle of least privilege** for API permissions
4. **Regularly rotate access tokens** and API keys
5. **Monitor API usage** to detect unusual activity

## Prerequisites by Platform

| Platform | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| X (Twitter) | X Developer Account, App with API v2 access |
| Facebook | Facebook App, Page Admin access, Graph API permissions |
| Instagram | Business/Creator account, Facebook App, Graph API access |
| Threads | Threads account, approved Threads App |

## Rate Limits

Each platform has different rate limits:

- **X**: Varies by API endpoint and access level
- **Facebook**: Varies by app usage and user activity
- **Instagram**: Limited by Graph API quotas
- **Threads**: Subject to Meta's API rate limits
