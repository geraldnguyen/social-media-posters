# Remote Media Support

All posting scripts in this repository support using remote media files (images, videos, etc.) by specifying an HTTP or HTTPS URL as the media file path. If the remote file is less than a configurable size limit (default: 5MB), the script will automatically download the file and use the downloaded local path for uploading to the social media platform.

- The maximum allowed download size can be set using the `MAX_DOWNLOAD_SIZE_MB` environment variable. If not set, the default is 5MB.
- This feature works for all scripts that accept media file paths (e.g., Post to X, Facebook, Instagram, Threads).
- If the file is too large or cannot be downloaded, the script will log an error and exit.

This makes it easy to use media hosted on the internet in your automated social media posts.
# Resolving Import Errors for Common Utilities

If you encounter import errors such as `Import "social_media_utils" could not be resolved` when running or editing the post-to-* scripts, follow these steps to ensure Python and your editor can find the `common` utilities:

## 1. Add `common` to PYTHONPATH

- Create a `.env` file in your project root (if it doesn't exist).
- Add the following line:
  - On Windows:
    ```
    PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH};${workspaceFolder}/common
    ```
  - On macOS/Linux:
    ```
    PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${workspaceFolder}/common
    ```

This allows both your scripts and VS Code to resolve imports like `from social_media_utils import ...`.

## 2. (Optional) VS Code Settings

You can also add the following to `.vscode/settings.json` to help Pylance find the `common` directory:

```json
{
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
    "./common"
  ]
}
```

## 3. Keep the sys.path Modification in Scripts

Each script already includes:

```python
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'common'))
```

This ensures the script works when run directly.

---
By following these steps, you can avoid import errors and keep your code modular and reusable across all post-to-* actions.

## Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Social Media Post
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  post-to-social-media:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Post to X
        uses: ./post-to-x
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.X_API_KEY }}
          api-secret: ${{ secrets.X_API_SECRET }}
          access-token: ${{ secrets.X_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          access-token-secret: ${{ secrets.X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}
          content: "üöÄ New release deployed! Check out the latest features."
      
      - name: Post to Facebook Page
        uses: ./post-to-facebook
        with:
          access-token: ${{ secrets.FB_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          page-id: ${{ secrets.FB_PAGE_ID }}
          content: "We've just released a new version with exciting features!"
          link: ${{ github.event.head_commit.url }}
```

## Common Features

All actions share these common features:

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with informative messages
- **Logging**: Configurable logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- **Validation**: Input validation for content and media files
- **Outputs**: Returns post ID and URL for further processing
- **Security**: Secure handling of API credentials via GitHub secrets

### Templated Content Helpers

All actions include a flexible templating engine that can pull values from environment variables, built-in timestamps, or remote JSON payloads referenced by `CONTENT_JSON`. In addition to basic lookups, you can apply pipe operations to transform list results:

#### Basic Operations
- `each:prefix(str)` adds the specified prefix to each element (great for turning categories into hashtags).
- `join(str)` concatenates all list items into a single string using the provided separator.

#### Case Transformation Operations  
- `each:case_title()` converts each element to Title Case
- `each:case_sentence()` converts each element to Sentence case
- `each:case_upper()` converts each element to UPPERCASE
- `each:case_lower()` converts each element to lowercase
- `each:case_pascal()` converts each element to PascalCase
- `each:case_kebab()` converts each element to kebab-case
- `each:case_snake()` converts each element to snake_case

Example:

```
CONTENT_JSON=https://example.com/data.json | stories[RANDOM]
POST_CONTENT=Updates: @{json.genres | each:case_upper() | each:prefix('#') | join(' ')}
```

If the selected story exposes a `genres` list of `mythology`, `tragedy`, and `supernatural`, the rendered content is:

```
Updates: #MYTHOLOGY #TRAGEDY #SUPERNATURAL
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API credentials** to your repository
2. **Use GitHub secrets** to store all sensitive information
3. **Follow the principle of least privilege** for API permissions
4. **Regularly rotate access tokens** and API keys
5. **Monitor API usage** to detect unusual activity

## Prerequisites by Platform

| Platform | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| X (Twitter) | X Developer Account, App with API v2 access |
| Facebook | Facebook App, Page Admin access, Graph API permissions |
| Instagram | Business/Creator account, Facebook App, Graph API access |
| Threads | Threads account, approved Threads App |

## Rate Limits

Each platform has different rate limits:

- **X**: Varies by API endpoint and access level
- **Facebook**: Varies by app usage and user activity
- **Instagram**: Limited by Graph API quotas
- **Threads**: Subject to Meta's API rate limits
